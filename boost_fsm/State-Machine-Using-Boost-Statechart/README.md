# Creating C++ State Machine(s) Using Boost::statechart Library (Mini eBook)

![alt tag](https://github.com/9lean/State-Machine-Using-Boost-Statechart/blob/master/StateMachine.png)

This mini eBook provides a step by step guide on using Boost::statechart (part of the boost C++ library @ www.boost.org) for creating state machines based software.

A large amount of code can potentially be written in the form of state machines. Sometimes even basic switch-case statements are a representation of miniature states. Many a time programmers create multiple states in the code without being explicitly aware of the fact that they are trying to emulate state machines.

__Why should one use exiting state machine framework instead of creating its own?__

Creating a proper state machine require lots of code and should behave as expected in most of the unpredictable scenarios. One may try it out, but it will take a hell lot of development and testing time, which instead could be used for coding the functionality.

Boost::statechart is a generic state machine which fulfills most of the basic requirements one can find in a state machines. It's my sincere opinion that one should at least explore this before deciding to write its own state machine.
